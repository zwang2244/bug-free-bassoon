# X-Team 52 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
As a group we will agree who gets what and that assigned person must consent to the task.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Ask each other how far we are and if we need help. Otherwise when we meet, we will have check-ups.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Message the entire group to communicate any problems we are having. Team can then suggest ideas and help write code if needed.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Set early deadlines so that the team can jump in and help a struggling member if necessary.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
None
